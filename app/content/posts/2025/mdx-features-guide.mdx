# MDX Features Guide

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. Here's what you can do with it!

## Standard Markdown

All standard markdown features work:

### Headings
Use `#` for headings (H1 through H6)

### Text Formatting
- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~strikethrough~~`
- `Inline code` with backticks

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting works out of the box:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('MDX'))
```

```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet('MDX')
```

```css
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
}
```

## Task Lists

Want to create checklists? While not supported by default GFM in our setup, you can use regular lists:

- [x] Set up MDX
- [x] Create blog posts
- [ ] Add more features
- [ ] Write more content

## Advanced Features

### Math (if configured)
While not enabled by default, MDX supports math rendering with appropriate plugins.

### Footnotes
MDX can support footnotes with the right remark plugins.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: Start with markdown, add complexity only when needed
2. **Use headings wisely**: Maintain a logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
3. **Code formatting**: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
4. **Alt text for images**: Always provide meaningful alt text
5. **Test your content**: Preview posts before publishing

## Writing Tips

- Use short paragraphs for better readability
- Add code examples to illustrate concepts
- Use lists and tables to organize information
- Break up long content with headings and horizontal rules
- Include a conclusion or call-to-action

## Conclusion

MDX provides a powerful way to create rich, interactive blog posts. Start with familiar markdown syntax and gradually incorporate more advanced features as needed.

Happy writing! 🎉
