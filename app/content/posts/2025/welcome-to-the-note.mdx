We're excited to introduce my new notes built with **MDX** and file-based routing. This powerful combination allows us to write rich, interactive content using markdown and React components.

## What's Special About These Notes?

### File-Based Content

All note posts are stored as `.mdx` files in the codebase, making it easy to:

- Version control your content
- Edit posts in your favorite editor
- Review changes through pull requests

### Full-Text Search

We've integrated client-side search using FlexSearch, providing instant results as you type.

### Categories and Tags

Organize content with categories and filter posts by tags for better discoverability.

## Technical Stack

These notes are built with:

- **Rails 8.1** - Backend framework
- **React 19** - Frontend UI
- **Inertia.js** - Bridge between Rails and React
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX support
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **FlexSearch** - Client-side search

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Ruby example:

```ruby
class NotePost
  def greet
    puts "Hello from MDX!"
  end
end
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const greeting = () => {
  console.log("Hello from MDX!");
};
```
