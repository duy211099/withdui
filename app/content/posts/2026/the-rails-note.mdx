# Views and Controllers
1. Web browser issues a request and an incoming url
2. Web server receives the request and pass it onto the Router
3. Router then dispatch the request to a specific Action in a Controller 
  - The Controller (simply, is a Ruby class) & an Action (is a Ruby method, we write to) handle the request
4. The Controller then interacts with Models (Ruby classes) to access data from the database
5. The Controller then passes the data to a ViewTemplate
6. The ViewTemplate then generates HTML necessary to display the data, then send back to the Web browser as a response

e.name = "Hi"
e.save

e = Event.new(name: "Hackathon", location: "Austin, TX", price: 15.00)

e = Event.create(name: "Kata Camp", location: "Dallas, TX", price: 75.00)
